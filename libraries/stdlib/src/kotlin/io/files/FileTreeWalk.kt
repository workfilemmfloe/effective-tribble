/**

/**
 * This class is intended to implement different file walk methods.
 * It allows to iterate through all files inside [start] directory.
 * If [start] is just a file, walker iterates only it.
 * If [start] does not exist, walker does not do any iterations at all.
 *
 * @param start directory to walk into.
 * @param direction selects top-down or bottom-up order (in other words, parents first or children first).
 * @param enter is called on any entered directory before its files are visited and before it is visited itself.
 * @param leave is called on any left directory after its files are visited and after it is visited itself.
 * @param fail is called on a directory when it's impossible to get its file list.
 * @param filter is called just before visiting a file, and if `false` is returned, file is not visited.
 * @param maxDepth is maximum walking depth, it must be positive. With a value of 1,
 * walker visits [start] and all its children, with a value of 2 also grandchildren, etc.
