This intention simplifies negated binary expressions by replacing expressions such as
!(<b>a</b> <small>op</small> <b>b</b>) with <b>a</b> <small>negop</small> <b>b</b>
(where <small>op</small> and <small>negop</small> are inverse comparison operators like <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b> or <b>in</b> and <b>!in</b>).
